## Introduction

This is a platform to manage APIs and allow users to call them. Our idea originated from the fact that platforms that offer free APIs on the market usually only have documentation and rarely provide direct interfaces for debugging them, while interface debugging platforms like postman do not provide common API resources. Therefore, we wanted to combine the two, to collect some interesting APIs, or provide some useful APIs developed by ourselves, and give their interface documentation and a platform to debug and use them.

In this platform, we have designed two types of users with permissions - administrator and normal user.

Administrator: publish API, downline API, add API, and can count and analyze the API calls.

Ordinary users: register and login, open API calling privileges, and use API.
